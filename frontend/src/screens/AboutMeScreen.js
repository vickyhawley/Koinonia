                <h1 className='aboutMePageTitle'>My Journey</h1>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>My name is Josephine Frenkel.  Let me tell you a little about myself. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>I was born in the Netherlands in the 1950s and have lived in many places.  I currently live in the UK and have done so for many years.  I could write a book on these times, some joyful but very often turbulent. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>I now live in a beautiful cosy cottage – with squirrels and many species of birds in my idyllic garden.  It is a rural setting at the edge of the small village of Pontlliw, on the outskirts of Swansea.  I have four children, now adults, one boy and three girls, also two mice-catching cats. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>I would like to share my “journey” with you.</p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>March 2016 – A long, hard time in my life and a very long spiritual search had passed.  It makes me shudder when I think about it.  I felt I had sussed out my life and decided that my way forward was New Age (or so I thought). </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>One day this month, without realising what was happening, I found myself having a major heart attack while travelling on a bus.  Thanks to the help of a passenger who got off and stayed with me, and of a friend, my life was saved.  Slowly I recovered. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>I had an eye for the beauty of nature and loved capturing with the camera what I saw around me – perhaps the web of a resting spider or raindrops like diamonds on a leaf.  I found joy and peace in creation.  I had taken a course in photography and my pictures were exhibited at the Grand Theatre Arts Wing. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>Both my heart attack and my photography exhibits were reported in the local “Evening Post”</p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>August 2016 – This is a month I will never forget.  As I said, I had been on a long spiritual journey.  I had looked at eastern religions, New Age teachings, and all that was weird and wonderful to me.  But in an instant my spiritual direction changed forever, and I have never looked back.  </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>May 2020 – We were in the Covid-19 pandemic and in and out of lockdown.  This was when my youngest daughter collapsed and was rushed into intensive care, put in an induced coma and on the ventilator.  She had been living with a serious eating disorder for some time.  It was a very stressful and heart-breaking time.  I was told for two weeks that she wouldn’t pull through.  However, after three months in hospital and despite the odds against her, and with Covid-19 around, she miraculously survived. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>July 2020 – Life had become somewhat slower since my heart attack.  At this time of heightened stress and lockdowns, a new period of creativity began with my painting a bottle.  I loved it and found it therapeutic. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>September 2020 – I tried my first ever painting and I was amazed that I could indeed create. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>November 2020 – I started experimenting with resin art and found myself painting more and more. This was great fun. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>December 2020 – I made sets of coasters, each original and unique, and was delighted how much they were appreciated. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>February 2021 – In my lovely but small cottage, my living room was the only space to do my art.  The lack of space was becoming unworkable.  A plan was soon formulated in my mind to somehow have extra space and my Christian church family listened to my ideas and put into action the building of a studio in my garden.  Possibly an easy thing to achieve with available finances, but I had none. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>March 2021 – The God of grace I had found in August 2016 made the impossible become possible. Wood piles were re-located.  An area was cleared.  People with building skills and other skills turned up to help to make the most amazing studio.  I couldn’t believe my eyes. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>June 2021 to August 2021 – My daughter number 2 was rushed into hospital with double pneumonia, sepsis, and necrosis.  She was in a coma for 5 weeks.  For three weeks I was told that she would not pull through.  However, because of the prayers of many, her miraculous recovery began, and she was taken off the ventilator.  She had a tracheotomy, but in one week she was breathing for herself.  Two weeks later, and to the utter amazement of the medics, she was eating, talking and in her own strength walked out of the hospital. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>In August when my daughter was still in hospital, I needed to have another heart procedure.  We were able to meet up for coffee and we were discharged within days of each another. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>I looked back on the previous 14 months which had been incredibly scary, heart-breaking, glorious and joyful.  Through all this my art studio provided a haven and a place for deep therapy.  It gave me my sanity and creativity.  My ideas and artwork developed. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>December 2021 – I was continuing with my art.  I was enjoying my gift of a studio, which was beyond my dreams. The studio not only helped my creativity, it also helped me to avoid falling into the pit of worry and despair.  Ideas started forming.  I wanted to give back out of the riches I felt I had received. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>For 10 years I had walked a painful journey with my youngest daughter who had a serious eating disorder.  In supporting her I discovered how little awareness there was about eating disorders and the challenges faced in providing for the needs of sufferers, not only in Swansea but also in Wales as a whole.  I wanted to help in some way with any monies I could raise from my art. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>My personal vision is to have better provision for people with eating disorders – to have a building in Swansea with consultation rooms, therapy rooms, art room, chill out room and kitchen.  I know this is a big dream which needs big money and big hearts.  The idea of “Have a Heart” was born.  I contacted people in the NHS and at various levels in government to tell them. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>January 2022 – The result of my dream began.  My art creations were photographed and KOINONIA STUDIO was registered as a social business.   It is really a “profit for purpose” company.  </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>February 2022 – I was guided in the direction of VETERANS ENTERPRISE UK and the BRITISH TRAINING BOARD who offered enormous support and help to hold an exhibition of my art.  I am most grateful and beginning to live the dream.  Nothing is impossible with God. </p>
                <p className='aboutMeStory'>The journey continues …            Thank you for taking the time to read “My Journey”. 

If you want to join me on this journey, I would love to hear from you.  You can pray, donate, purchase pieces of art or get involved in displaying my art in some way.
